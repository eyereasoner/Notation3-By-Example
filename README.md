# Notation3 by Example

This repository contains a growing collection of examples how to use
[Notation3](https://w3c.github.io/N3/spec/) [built-ins](https://w3c.github.io/N3/files/builtins.html).

The Notation3 built-ins are still a part of current specification development. Don't assume that all examples will be part of the official spec. Check the Notation3 specification for the official list and interpratation of the built-ins.

The examples are based on two lists of Notation3 built-ins:

- https://w3c.github.io/N3/files/builtins.html
- https://w3c.github.io/N3/spec/#builtins

The examples only use built-ins for which at least one example was found in the [EYE](https://github.com/eyereasoner/eye) or [jen3](https://github.com/william-vw/jen3) or [CWM](https://github.com/sbp/cwm) project.

Run the code online by copy and pasting into the online [Notation3 Editor](http://ppr.cs.dal.ca:3002/n3/editor/).
