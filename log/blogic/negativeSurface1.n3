# (_:X _:Y) is like For all X and Y) within the surface
# log:negativeSurface claims the RDF graph on the surface
# is false.
#
# To have a NOT in a logic is quite powerfull. The implication
# P -> Q is equivalent to ~P OR Q . Keeping this in mind
# we can construct implication from negativeSurfaces.
#
# E.g. using De Morgan's laws
#
# ~( P -> Q ) <=> ~(~P OR Q) <=> ~~P AND ~Q  <=> P AND ~Q 
#    
# from which follows:
#
# ( P -> Q ) <=> ~( P AND ~Q ) 
#
# Which means we can nest log:negativeSurface to express P -> Q
#   
# What in N3 was:
#    { ?X a ?Y } => { ?Y a :Test } .
